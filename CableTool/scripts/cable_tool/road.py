"""The road builder: a Maya node that turns a route into a road.

    anchor world matrices, ground mesh, settings  ->  roadToolBuilder
        -> outSurface, outMarkings, outCentreLine, outSidewalks, outVerge
           (five meshes), plus the colours of the built-in materials

Every time an input changes it:

1. Lays out the centre line: straight runs between anchors blended to a
   curve through them (Path Curve), sampled every Segment Length.
2. Banks the curves the way a road engineer would: superelevation from
   the curve's radius and the Design Speed, capped at Banking and eased
   in and out along the road (no step at the start of a curve).
3. Builds a level cross-section at every sample: lanes either side of
   the centre line with a crown for drainage, paved shoulders, then
   optional curbs and sidewalks. The road climbs and turns, but a level
   road never tilts sideways with the terrain, only with the crown and
   banking.
4. With a Ground mesh: sets the road's height from the ground under its
   whole width, smoothed over Grade Smoothing so it doesn't follow every
   bump, no steeper than Max Grade, and kept above the ground so the
   terrain never covers it (it is raised on fill, never cut in). Side
   slopes (embankments, or cuts into a hillside) run from each edge down
   or up to the ground at Side Slope.
5. Paints the markings as their own strips just above the surface:
   centre line, lane lines and edge lines, dashes at Dash Length / Dash
   Gap. Gravel and dirt roads get none: paint doesn't hold on them.

UVs on the surface are laid out for lane markings: U runs 0 to 1 across
the paved width, from the left edge to the right, and V counts dash
cycles along the road (one V tile = one dash + one gap), so a painted
road texture lines up with the modelled dashes. Markings, sidewalks and
side slopes have UVs in scene units.
